## Description

This utility aims to help users easily setup full-disk encryption. To do this the user would use a bootable medium (preferably a live CD such as Clonezilla) to encrypt the desired drive. 

#Reminders to write about:
#State that this tool (for the moment) only is used to 'stapple' encryption onto the drive. Explain the security risks in doing so #and provide alternative methods for acheiving a safer setup.
#Add efi support and signing uefi keys.
